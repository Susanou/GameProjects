# UnrealProjects

Repository to host unreal game projects I'm working on. Currently following a [Udemy Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealengine-cpp/).

## [StealthGame](/StealthGame)

Stealth FPS game. Fully multiplayer. Additional challenges from the course added to the project

## [CoopGame](/CoopGame)

Coop third person shooter. More of a focus on AI for this project but similar to the stealth game project previously done. This project is also a multiplayer game.
